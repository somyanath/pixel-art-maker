# pixel-art-maker

An intuitive and simple to use pixel art maker. It has the functionality of creating a grid of specific size, draw/erase by click. In the future I will be adding the functionality of draw/erase by click and drag along with adding "+"/"-" buttons for increasing and decreasing row and column size.

TECH STACK: HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT
